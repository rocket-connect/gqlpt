# Adapters

GQLPT uses AI adapters to power its natural language processing capabilities. These adapters serve as the bridge between your plain text queries and the sophisticated AI models that generate GraphQL queries.

## What are Adapters?

Adapters in GQLPT are modules that connect to specific AI providers, allowing the system to leverage different AI models for query generation. They handle the communication with the AI service, process the responses, and ensure that the generated GraphQL queries align with your schema and requirements.

## Why Use Different Adapters?

1. **Flexibility**: Choose the AI provider that best suits your needs and preferences.
2. **Performance**: Different adapters may perform better for specific types of queries or domains.
3. **Cost Management**: Adapters allow you to use the most cost-effective AI service for your use case.
4. **Customization**: Create custom adapters to integrate with your own AI models or services.

## Available Adapters

GQLPT currently supports the following adapters:

1. [OpenAI Adapter](./openai): Utilizes OpenAI's powerful language models.
2. [Anthropic Adapter](./anthropic): Leverages Anthropic's AI technology.

Each adapter has its own configuration options and best practices. In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into each adapter, explaining how to set them up and use them effectively in your GQLPT projects.
